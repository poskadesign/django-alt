# django-alt version changelog

### 1.0.0b4
 - added `mixins.py` with `CamelcaseTransformMixin` which automatically 
 transforms keys of return objects between `camelCase` and `snake_case`.
 - added `recursive_key_map` to `utils/iterables`.
 - added `underscore_to_camelcase` and `camelcase_to_underscore` conversion functions 
 to `utils/string`.

### 1.0.0b3
 - added shortcut `copyattrs`.

### 1.0.0b2
 - added `custom` attribute for endpoints that when set, allows not having to define 
 serializers and models on the endpoint and suppresses other checks.
 - fixed accessing `request.data` without a fallback in `ViewPrototype.respond`.

### 1.0.0b1
 - initial 1.0 beta release.

### 0.73
 - `view_prototype` now doesn't return a 404 when a `QuerySet.get` fails with 
 `ObjectDoesNotExist` with HTTP PUT, instead creating a new object from request data.

### 0.71
 - Endpoint handlers now accept `HttpResponse` subclass as a return parameter.

### 0.70

 Breaking changes:
 
 - `post_can` permission callable now includes `url` dict as its second parameter.
    - before: `lambda request, queryset, attrs: True`.
    - after: `lambda request, url, queryset, attrs: True`.
 - `did_delete` lifecycle hook doesn't accept the `attrs` parameter anymore.
 
 Updates:
 - `clean_` and `field_` `Validator` functions are now passed an optional `attrs` argument.
 - `on_put` endpoint handler implementation.
 - `ValidatedManager` introduces `create_many`, `update` and `delete` functions. These work as they would in `Manager`s but
    use a given `Validator` instance to validate data beforehand. 
 - `Validator` object now includes a `request` and `permission_test` parameters that are 
        automatically passed in by endpoints/serializers.
 - Code is now compliant and works with Django 1.11.
 - Added new shortcuts:
   - `coald` &ndash; a deferred variation of the null-coalescing operator.
   - `is_iterable` &ndash; shortcut for checking if object is an iterable (strings are excluded).
   - `prohibited` &ndash; shortcut for raising a validation error about an existing prohibited field.
   - `prohibited_any` &ndash; shortcut for raising a validation error when any of the given fields exist in the container.
   - `required` &ndash; shortcut for raising a validation error about a missing required field..
   - `valid_if` &ndash; asserts that a predicate is correct, raising a `serializers.ValidationError` otherwise.
   - `ensures` &ndash; (alias of `valid_if`) used in Design by Contract methodology to denote that a callable 
   asserts that a given condition is true before executing any code.
   - `expects` &ndash; (alias of `valid_if`) used in Design by Contract methodology to denote that a callable 
   asserts that a given condition is true after its code block is executed.
 - Added `no_save` parameter to `ValidatedManager.__init__` that skips the actual `ObjectManager` calls if defined.
 - Some new error messages introduced and others made more user friendly.
 - Documentation updated to include more relevant info and examples.



### 0.61
 - Introduced `ValidatedManager` that allows validate data before 
 creating a new model instance.
 - Introduced wildcard cleaners: similarly to wildcard field validators, cleaners are
 are `clean_<field_name>` functions that are expected to return a cleaned value
 for the field. The return value is then set on the `attrs` `dict`.
 - Shortcut `coal_first` renamed to a more memorable `first_defined`.
 - Improved test coverage.

### 0.60
 - Improved documentation (`readme.md`, `recipes.md`), added `indepth.md`.
 - Introduced wildcard validators: ability to defined arbitrary functions
 to validate individual fields or all attributes collectively. More information
 on this in `indepth.md`.
 - Introduced automatic query parameter casting (e.g. where possible `"1"` -> `1`, 
 `"true"` -> `True`, etc.). This feature can be turned off by adding
 `no_url_param_casting` in the config dict on the endpoint.
 - Broadened `pre_permission` and `post_permission` definition to include
 absolute values instead of callables:
    - `True`  -> permission always granted,
    - `False` -> permission never granted,
    - `None`  -> no permission needed (`True` <=> `None`, the distinction is only semantic).
 - Added `ValidatedModelListSerializer`.
 - Added `coal_first` shortcut function. It finds the first argument 
 that is not `None` and doesn't raise a `KeyError`.
 - Added `compose_and` shortcut. It composes an iterable of callables 
 with identical signatures and asserts universal quantification for their results.
 - Added `pre_logged_in` permission shortcut.

### 0.50
 - In addition to individual field validation, it is now possible to define
 own methods on the `Validator` that are automatically called upon create/update.
 The rules of custom function definition on `Validator` is as follows:
  - `field_<field_name>` if defined, these functions are called for each serializer field. 
  These functions accept one parameter &ndash; `value` (the given field's value).
  - `check_*` any defined function starting with `check_` is called automatically in an
     alphabetical order after `base` validation. These functions accept one
     parameter &ndash; `attrs` dict.
  - It is also worthwhile to know that `check_*` functions **should not** mutate the
   attrs object

### 0.40
 - Option to validate individual fields. This allows even more separation
 of concerns. Now serializer calls `check_<field>` on the model validator for each
 `<field>` defined on the serializer (only if its value was in `attrs`).
 This validation happens *after* `base` validation is completed. Note that at this stage
 the `attrs` dict is **not** mutated.

### 0.30
 - Added `fields_from_url` parameter to endpoint `config`. Until now  
 serializer fields were only specified in request body. This allows a structured and
  straightforward way to retrieve their values from URL parameters.
 - Added `recipes.md` document that aims to provide short self&ndash;explanatory 
 code excerpts.
 useful for quick scenario look-up (think *cheat&ndash;sheet*).

### 0.24
 - Added shortcuts `if_all_in` and `if_any_in`.

### 0.23
 - Added `coal` null-coalescing shortcut.
 - Updated `validate` attrs replacement behaviour.
 
### 0.22
 - Added `serializer` back-reference to abstract validator.
 - Updated `validate` method to replace `attrs` reference, if a new object is returned from validator methods.
 - Fixed appending dot after an exclamation mark in `make_error` function.
 
### 0.21
- `tests` folder renamed to `django_alt_tests` to avoid clashes. 

### 0.2
- Full implementation of `Endpoint`, `Validator` and `ValidatedSerializer` interfaces.
- Initial test coverage for project.

### 0.1
 - Initial version containing the basic file structure.
